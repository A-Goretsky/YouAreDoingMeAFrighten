A1: Introduction to digital pictures and color
    1. How many bits does it take to represent the values from 0 to 255?
        A: 8 bits
    2. How many bytes does it take to represent a color in the RGB color model?
        A: 3 bytes
    3. How many pixels are in a picture that is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high?
        A: 307,200 pixels

A2: Picking a color
    1. How can you make pink?
        A: [r=255,g=100,b=165]
    2. How can you make yellow?
        A: [r=255,g=255,b=0]
    3. How can you make purple?
        A: [r=165,g=0,b=255]
    4. How can you make white?
        A: [r=255,g=255,b=255]
    5. How can you make a dark gray
        A: [r=80,g=80,b=80]

A3: Exploring a picture
    1. What is the row index for the top left corner of the picture?
        A: 0
    2. What is the column index for the top left corner of the picture?
        A: 0
    3. The width of this picture is 640. What is the right most column index?
        A: 639
    4. The height of this picture is 480. What is the bottom most row index?
        A: 479
    5. Does the row index increase from left to right or top to bottom?
        A: Top to Bottom
    6. Does the column index increase from left to right or top to bottom?
        A: Left to Right

A4: Two-dimensional arrays in Java

A5: Modifying a picture
    1. Open Picture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there?
        A: No
    2. Open SimplePicture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there?
        A: Yes
    3. Does the folloing code compile?
        DigitalPicture p = new DigitalPicture();
        A: No
    4. Assuming that a no-arguement constructor exists for SimplePicture, would the following code compile?
        DigitalPicture p = new SimplePicture();
        A: Yes
    5. Assuming that a no-arguement constructor exists for Picture, would the following code compile?
        DigitalPicture p = new Picture();
        A: Yes
    6. Assuming that a no-arguement constructor exists for Picture, would the following code compile?
        SimplePicture p = new Picture();
        A: Yes
    7. Assuming that a no-arguement constructor exists for SimplePicture, would the following code compile?
        Picture p = new SimplePicture();
        A: No

            for (int col = 6; col < 15; col++)
        A: 90 times
    2. How many times would the body of this nested for loop execute?
        for (int row = 5; row <= 11; row++)
